## Desctiption

This is an academic project where a virtual video rental store has been developed using an ATDD methodology. Its objective was restricted to develop the model and application logic, and a simple GUI (in spanish language) has been implemented with JavaFX.

The database has been omitted in this repository and, instead of it, this project uses a stub database with some initial data for testing the whole system. There are two users:

user: admin  
pass: admin  
<br/>
user: socio  
pass: socio  

## Linux users

JavaFX is not included in OpenJDK8. In this case, the packages `openjfx` and `libopenjfx-java` are required in order to run this Java application.
